            <p>es, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. File not found.

                    Why did you bring us here? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. You lived before you met me?! I just told you! You've killed me! And until then, I can never die?
                    
                    But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</p>

                I'm a thing. Fatal. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.

                I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. With gusto. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!
                
                No! The cat shelter's on to me. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." I had more, but you go ahead. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!
                
                Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.
                
                Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! You know, I was God once. I love you, buddy! Belligerent and numerous.
                
                I'm Santa Claus! No, she'll probably make me do it. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Ummm…to eBay? Oh, I think we should just stay friends.
                
                Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. I'll get my kit!
